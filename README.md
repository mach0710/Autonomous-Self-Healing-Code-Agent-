# Autonomous-Self-Healing-Code-Agent-
An agentic AI system built with Python, LangGraph, and Llama-3 that automates the full software development lifecycle. It autonomously generates code, authors unit tests, executes the logic in a secure Docker sandbox, and self-heals by analyzing error tracebacks to iteratively fix bugs until all tests pass.
